# Address Management System

This project is a simple Node.js backend application for managing users and their addresses using a relational database (SQLite). It implements a one-to-many relationship between users and addresses, allowing users to have multiple addresses. The frontend is a simple HTML form that submits user data to the backend, and the saved users and their addresses are displayed on the page.


## Features
